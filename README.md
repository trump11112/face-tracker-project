# Face Tracker Project

## Overview

This project is a simple face tracker application that uses [describe the core technology, e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe] to detect and track faces in real-time. It's designed to be [mention the primary purpose, e.g., a starting point for more complex projects, a demonstration of face tracking capabilities].

## Features

* **Real-time face tracking:** Tracks faces in video streams from [mention sources, e.g., webcams, video files].
* **[Optional] Servo control:** If applicable, mention any integration with servos for physical camera movement.
* **[Optional] Configuration:** Describes how to set up the config file.
* **Simple setup:** Easy to install and get running.
* [Add any other key features]

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * pip (Python package installer)
    * Git

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    cd face_tracker_simple_install
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * If `requirements.txt` is not found, you will have to install the dependencies manually.

5.  **Configuration:**
    * Copy the default configuration file:
        ```bash
        cp config/config_default.yaml config/config.yaml
        ```
    * Edit `config/config.yaml` to set up your camera and other settings.  Pay close attention to the camera RTSP URL and servo configurations.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd face_tracker_simple_install
    ```

2.  **Run the face tracker:**

    ```bash
    python scripts/run_tracker.py
    ```

## Configuration Details

The `config/config.yaml` file contains the following settings:

* **`camera_url`:** The URL of your video stream (e.g., webcam, RTSP feed).
* **`servo_control`:** (If applicable) Settings for controlling servos, including:
    * `pan_pin`:  The GPIO pin for the pan servo.
    * `tilt_pin`: The GPIO pin for the tilt servo.
    * `center_x`: The center X-coordinate of the camera view.
    * `center_y`: The center Y-coordinate of the camera view.
* **`face_detection_model`**: The model to use for face detection (e.g., 'haarcascade', 'mediapipe').
* [Add descriptions of other important configuration options]

## Troubleshooting

* **"ImportError: No module named..."**:  Make sure you have activated the virtual environment and installed the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **Camera feed issues:** Double-check your camera URL in the configuration file.  Ensure your camera is properly connected and providing a valid stream.
* [Add other common issues and solutions]
